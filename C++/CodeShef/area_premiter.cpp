// Write a program for the following problem

// Letâ€™s consider a rectangle of sides 11 and 13.
// Find and output area of the rectangle having length as 11 and breadth as 13
// Find and output perimeter of the rectangle having length as 11 and breadth as 13
// For any rectangle, the formula for area is length * breadth.
// The formula for perimeter is 2 * (length + breadth)
